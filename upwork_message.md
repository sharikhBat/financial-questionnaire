**Instead of a proposal, I built your product.**

Here's a working prototype: https://financial-questionnaire-nu.vercel.app/

Tap through it on your phone — 6-question flow, mock checkout, AI-generated financial plan at the end. Built with Next.js, Tailwind, and OpenAI. Stripe integration is stubbed and ready to wire up.

I did this in a few hours. The full MVP won't take long.

**Quick background:**
- Top-rated freelancer on Upwork under [BeneathATree](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01bb556a1c4505523e)
- Built and scaled Speak2's software platform
- Shipped SMI from scratch as a new product

I've built MVPs like this before. This is squarely in my wheelhouse.

**$1,500 flat fee.** No hourly billing, no surprises. You get the full MVP — questionnaire flow, Stripe checkout, AI report generation, admin editing, and deployed to production.

Happy to jump on a quick call if you want to walk through the prototype together.
